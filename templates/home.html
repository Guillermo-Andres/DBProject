<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">A database application consists of many different areas within the realm of software. Applications are interconnected by various frameworks that allow for quick database management systems to easily provide information to a client. A client is usually a barebones application that can make requests to a server that hosts the database to query the required information. To begin our journey in the realm of database systems we were tasked to employ a mock warehouse management system web application with the help of the python FLASK web framework and a POSTGRESQL database to house the required information. To begin the preliminary design of the application we were given a list of resources and required operations our system needed to support. From there we needed to develop an E-R diagram of the logical model of our database and develop mock operation handlers to begin the preliminary design of our application.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="93" data-line-end="94">As stated previously the application is built with the FLASK web framework on top of our machine’s standard IP (127.0.0.1.). It consists of the main application module which houses all of our application’s routes along with the CRUD operations that are required to be operated by each route. We built a database following the ER diagram. For this development phase, we are using dummy data to implement all the GET operations. Handlers were developed for each table on our E-R along with its data access object which is in charge of performing the queries on our database. A set of operations is to be supported, so a distinct route for each operation is necessary. For example, we design a route to view all requested items which is located at @app.route(’/almacenespr/requested’, methods = [‘GET’]), in this route we employ the request handler in order to identify requested resources. As for the request table, each table has its specific handler to respond to the operations.</p>
